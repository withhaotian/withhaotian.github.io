== About me
Currently, I am a second-year Ph.D. candidate of [https://cs.nju.edu.cn/main.htm Department of Computer Science and Technology], [https://www.nju.edu.cn/ Nanjing University (NJU)], under the supervision of [https://cs.nju.edu.cn/douwanchun/index.htm Prof. Wanchun Dou]. From August 2024 to November 2024, I have worked as a Visiting Ph.D. Student at School of Computing, [https://www.mq.edu.au/ Macquarie University], supervised by [https://researchers.mq.edu.au/en/persons/xuyun-zhang Dr. Xuyun Zhang]. Before that, I received my M.Sc. in Software Engineering and B.Eng. in Computer Science from [https://www.nuist.edu.cn/ Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology (NUIST)] in 2023 and 2020, respectively, advised by [https://faculty.nuist.edu.cn/xuxiaolong/zh_CN/index.htm Prof. Xiaolong Xu]. 

My research interest is centered on Edge AI Computing/System (a paper list is available in this [https://github.com/withhaotian/awesome-edge-AI-papers.git respository]), with particular emphasis on distributed edge inference, serverless edge computing, and resource management in cloud-edge computing systems.
